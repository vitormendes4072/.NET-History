# What's, How and Where use .NET?

## What's?

It's a software development infrastructure from Microsoft.

.NET application is designed for some .NET implementations: 

- .NET Core
- .NET Framework
- Mono
- Universal Windows Platform (UWP)

## How?

Microsoft created .NET Standard, which is actually a contract. To implement a specific version, you will need to have some functionalities working.

Each implementation includes one or plus .NET Runtimes:

- **.NET Core:** CoreCLR and CoreRT;
- **.NET Framework:** CLR;
- **Mono:** Mono Runtime;
- **UWP:** .NET Native.

.NET 5 was created to unify all of these .NET Runtimes in one place.

.NET is compatible with three languages:

- C# (object-oriented);
- F# (function-oriented).
- Visual Basic.
